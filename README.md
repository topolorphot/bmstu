# ðŸ”º Triangle Minimum Path Sum

This project solves the problem of finding the minimum path sum from the top to the base of a triangle, where each step can move to adjacent numbers below.

## ðŸ§© Example

```python
triangle = [
    [2],
    [3,4],
    [6,5,7],
    [4,1,8,3]
]

# Result:
# Path: 2 â†’ 3 â†’ 5 â†’ 1
# Sum = 11
# bmstu
